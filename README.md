# Santa-s-Naughty-or-Nice-List
This is a small Java project I made during sophomore year of college. It's an application that writes, reads, and displays the name, gender, address, and requested gift of those on either the nice or naughty list by user's input. Yes, this was for Christmas time. It's written in Core Java.
